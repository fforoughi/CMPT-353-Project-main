# An Analysis of NBA Scoring, 1980-2024

#### Brayden Butt, Watson Li, Frayan Foroughi

### Requirements

The following Python libraries are required: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, and `sklearn`. 

### Instructions

To run the code for the analysis, simply run all blocks of the Jupyter notebook. 

The datafiles used for the analyses are in a `/data/` directory, and the code has accounted for that; as a result, after cloning the repository, the notebook can be run as is with the current file structure intact. All outputs will be shown in the notebook output, and the only external file created by the notebook is `shots_heatmap.gif`, an animated heatmap showing binned shots over time, which is also shown below in this ReadMe as Jupyter cell outputs are unable to display frames of a gif beyond the first; certain cell outputs can also be tweaked as necessary (sort orders, number of leading elements to print).

No markdown blocks were used; we used a notebook solely for its output capabilities. Instead, the code was thoroughly commented, and the report PDF in the repository provides additional reasoning and justification for how the analysis was conducted.
